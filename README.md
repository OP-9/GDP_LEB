# GDP_LEB

The potential relationship of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the life expectancy at birth (LEB) for six nations was investigated.

The data present in the dataset was for the period 2000 to 2015. The following countries were analaysed: Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, United States of America, and Zimbabwe.

The following points were analysed:

*  Each country's GPD growth (or decline) over time
*  The progression of the LEB for each country
*  Comparision of each country's respective GDP's and life expectancies at birth amongst the other five countries
*  Relationship between life expectancy at birth and GDP for each nation

Conclusion: In the given timeframe, all six countries experienced a growth in their GDPs, albeit to various degrees. The life expectancy at birth also increased for all six nations, with Zimbabwe experiencing the largest LEB increase despite a relatively modest increase in their GDP.
Assuming no other factors contributed to the life expectancy at birth, one can conclude that the life expectancy at birth increased due to the respective country's gdp growth.
